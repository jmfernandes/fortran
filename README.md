=======

This repository includes simple fortran programs. The goal of this repository is to strengthen understanding of fortran.  

List of included programs
-------------------------

* hello.f90  
	this program simply prints "hello worlld"
* cylinder.f90  
	this program was copied from an example online. It computes the volume of a cylinder. I will add my own improvements.
* factorial.f90  
	this program computes the factorial of a number entered by the user.
* change.f90  
	This program asks for two inputs: the price of an item and the money given by a customer. It then returns the change to be given in the amount of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
* ball.f95  
	This program calculates the trajectory of a ball with initial conditions of initial velocity, initial height, and angle relative to the horizontal. Possible outputs or x,y,x-velocity, and y-velocity.
* scattering.f95  
	This program calculates the scattering coefficient based on four different values of $\Gamma$
